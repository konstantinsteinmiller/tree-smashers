# Leaderboard setup, start to finish

Every command below is run in PowerShell on Windows, from the repo root unless
it says otherwise. The Worker is already named for this game —
`leaderboard-tree-smashers` — so the commands can be pasted as they stand; the only
value you have to fill in yourself is the D1 `database_id` that step 3 prints.

The board's SCORE is the highest campaign stage a player has ever reached, and
`power` (the second column) is the summed upgrade levels of their team.

Nothing here touches the game's behaviour until step 7: until
`VITE_LEADERBOARD_URL` is set, the client treats the board as "feature off" and
the result screen simply shows no rank.

---

## 1. Install the Worker toolchain

The Worker has its own `package.json`, deliberately separate from the game's —
it deploys on its own schedule and shares none of the game's dependencies.

```powershell
cd worker
npm install
```

(`pnpm install` works too. The lockfile it creates is local to `worker/`.)

## 2. Authorise the CLI

```powershell
npx wrangler login
```

A browser tab opens on the account you are already signed into. Click **Allow**.
The terminal then prints `Successfully logged in`. Confirm the account:

```powershell
npx wrangler whoami
```

## 3. Create the database

```powershell
npx wrangler d1 create leaderboard-tree-smashers
```

It prints a block like this:

```toml
[[d1_databases]]
binding = "DB"
database_name = "leaderboard-tree-smashers"
database_id = "0f2c9a51-....-............"
```

**Copy the `database_id` value** into `worker/wrangler.toml`, replacing
`REPLACE_ME`. That one line is the only edit the file needs.

## 4. Create the tables

```powershell
npm run db:init
```

This runs `schema.sql` against the **remote** database (the real one, not the
local emulator). Wrangler asks before touching remote data — answer `y`. You
should see two `CREATE TABLE` statements and one `CREATE INDEX` execute.

Verify from the dashboard if you like: **Storage & Databases → D1 →
leaderboard-tree-smashers → Tables** should now list `scores` and `board_cache`.

## 5. Deploy

```powershell
npm run deploy
```

On a brand-new account this asks you to register a `workers.dev` subdomain
first — pick anything, it becomes part of the URL. When it finishes it prints:

```
Published leaderboard-tree-smashers
  https://leaderboard-tree-smashers.hyperg8.workers.dev
```

**That URL is what the game needs.** Keep it.

## 6. Check it is alive

```powershell
$BOARD = 'https://leaderboard-tree-smashers.hyperg8.workers.dev'

# The board — empty at this point, which is the correct answer.
Invoke-RestMethod "$BOARD/top"

# Post a fake score and get a rank back.
$body = @{ id = 'testplayer01'; name = 'Tester'; score = 137; power = 21 } | ConvertTo-Json
Invoke-RestMethod -Method Post -ContentType 'application/json' -Body $body "$BOARD/score"
```

The first returns `entries: {}` / `total: 0`. The second returns
`rank: 1, best: 137, total: 1`, and re-running `/top` now shows the entry.

Sanity-check the guards while you are here — both should be **rejected**:

```powershell
# 422: a score past MAX_SCORE.
$bad = @{ id = 'testplayer01'; name = 'Cheat'; score = 999999999; power = 3 } | ConvertTo-Json
Invoke-RestMethod -Method Post -ContentType 'application/json' -Body $bad "$BOARD/score"

# 429: two writes for the same id inside the 3 s cooldown — run the good POST
#      above twice in a row.
```

Delete the test row when you are done:

```powershell
npx wrangler d1 execute leaderboard-tree-smashers --remote `
  --command "DELETE FROM scores WHERE id = 'testplayer01'"
# The cached blob still holds the old table until BOARD_TTL_MS expires and a
# read rebuilds it (writes no longer rebuild) — clear it to see the change now:
npx wrangler d1 execute leaderboard-tree-smashers --remote --command "DELETE FROM board_cache"
```

## 7. Point the game at it

In the repo root, edit `.env`:

```
VITE_LEADERBOARD_URL=https://leaderboard-tree-smashers.hyperg8.workers.dev
VITE_LEADERBOARD_SECRET=
```

Vite loads `.env` for **every** build mode, so this one line switches the board
on for all of them. Two consequences worth knowing:

* **You do not need to touch `csp.ts`.** `buildCsp()` reads this same variable
  and folds the ORIGIN into `connect-src` itself, so the policy can never fall
  out of step with the endpoint.
* **The offline portals are the exception.** Poki forbids every external runtime
  request; Yandex's moderators reject third-party storage endpoints found
  anywhere in the bundle. Both build with the URL empty and ship the baked
  snapshot instead — add this line to `.env.poki.local` and `.env.yandex.local`:

  ```
  VITE_LEADERBOARD_URL=
  ```

Now run the game, finish a run, and check the result screen shows the rank
badge. In devtools' Network tab you should see exactly one request to the
Worker: a `POST /score` on a personal record, or a `GET /top` when it is not.

## 8. Ship it

Nothing extra — every `build:*` script picks the variable up from `.env`. To
confirm before uploading, grep the built HTML for the origin; it must be in the
CSP meta tag:

```powershell
Select-String -Path dist\index.html -Pattern "workers.dev"
```

## Upgrading: player builds (migration 0002)

`POST /score` can now carry the player's BUILD — both spinners' parts, levels
and skins plus the equipped skills — stored on their row for the league
(`build`, `build_at`, `lpower`). An existing database needs the new columns
BEFORE the Worker that writes them goes live. Order matters:

1. **Migrate** (from `worker/`; answer `y`):

   ```powershell
   cd worker
   npx wrangler d1 execute leaderboard-tree-smashers --remote --file=./migrations/0002_player_build.sql
   ```

   Four statements run (three `ALTER TABLE`, one `CREATE INDEX`). Running it a
   second time fails with `duplicate column name: build` — that just means it
   is already applied.

2. **Deploy the Worker**: `npm run deploy`. It still accepts every old client
   (no build, v1 signature) unchanged.

3. **Ship the clients** (the normal `build:*` flow). New clients post their
   build with every record / rename, plus at most one build-only refresh per
   6 h when the team changed. A refresh only ever updates the build columns —
   never the score or its timestamp, so it cannot move anyone on the board.

Shipping clients before step 2 is harmless too (the old Worker ignores the
extra field), but never deploy the Worker before step 1: its first INSERT would
fail on the missing columns and every post would answer 503.

Check it took:

```powershell
npx wrangler d1 execute leaderboard-tree-smashers --remote `
  --command "SELECT COUNT(*) AS with_build FROM scores WHERE build IS NOT NULL"
```

A fresh database (`npm run db:init`) gets the columns from `schema.sql`
directly and must NOT run the migration. On an existing database run the
migration before ever re-running `db:init`: `schema.sql`'s new index names the
`build` column and fails on a table that does not have it yet.

With `SCORE_SECRET` set, a build-carrying post is signed
`id:score:power:digest` (v2); the old `id:score:power` (v1) is still accepted,
and a v1-signed post that carries a build keeps its score but drops the
unsigned build.

## Upgrading: the league (migration 0003)

The Worker also serves the simulated-PvP league under `/league/*`
(`worker/src/league.ts`): opponent pools, the player's standing, the league
top, and the battle start / result pair. It needs two new tables and one new
secret. Order matters — run everything from `worker/`:

1. **Migration 0002 first** (the section above), if it has not been applied:
   league opponents are read from the `build` columns it adds.

2. **Migrate 0003** (answer `y`):

   ```powershell
   cd worker
   npx wrangler d1 execute leaderboard-tree-smashers --remote --file=./migrations/0003_league.sql
   ```

   Only `CREATE ... IF NOT EXISTS` (tables `league`, `league_cache` and one
   index), so running it twice is harmless. It never touches `scores`.

3. **Set the league secret** (paste any long random string when asked):

   ```powershell
   npx wrangler secret put LEAGUE_SECRET
   ```

   Server-only: it signs battle tokens and is never put in the game's `.env`.
   Rotating it only invalidates battles in flight (they then count as
   losses once they expire).

4. **Deploy**: `npm run deploy`. The leaderboard routes are unchanged.

Check it took:

```powershell
$w = "https://leaderboard-tree-smashers.<your-subdomain>.workers.dev"
Invoke-RestMethod "$w/league/top"          # { season, total: 0, entries: [], dist: [] }
Invoke-RestMethod "$w/league/pool?band=4"  # opponents with a posted build, power ~24-59
```

A `503 {"error":"league offline"}` from `POST /league/start` means the secret
is missing. A fresh database (`npm run db:init`) gets the league tables from
`schema.sql` and needs neither migration.

Free-tier cost: a ranked fight is one read + one write on `/league/start` and
one read + one write on `/league/result`. Pools (per power band, 10 min), the
league top (5 min) and its histogram (hourly) are materialised in
`league_cache` and edge-cached for 60 s, with a day-long emergency copy served
when D1 refuses.

## Running it locally (optional)

Useful when changing the Worker itself — no deploys, no remote data:

```powershell
cd worker
npm run db:init:local     # tables in the local emulator
npm run dev               # http://localhost:8787
```

For the league routes locally, put `LEAGUE_SECRET=<anything>` in
`worker/.dev.vars` (gitignored — never commit it).

Then set `VITE_LEADERBOARD_URL=http://localhost:8787` in the game's `.env` while
you work. The edge cache is a no-op locally, so every `/top` hits the database —
that is expected and does not reflect production behaviour.

## Signed submissions (optional)

Raises the bar against hand-rolled POSTs. It does not make the board
tamper-proof: the secret ships inside a public bundle, so a determined player
can extract it. The bound in `plausible()` is what actually caps the damage.

```powershell
cd worker
npx wrangler secret put SCORE_SECRET     # paste any long random string
npm run deploy
```

Then put the **same** string in the repo root `.env`:

```
VITE_LEADERBOARD_SECRET=<the same string>
```

Both sides must be set or neither: the Worker only demands a signature when
`SCORE_SECRET` exists, and the client only sends one when
`VITE_LEADERBOARD_SECRET` does. Either order of rollout is safe.

## Locking down origins (optional, later)

`ALLOWED_ORIGINS` in `wrangler.toml` is empty, which allows any origin. That is
the right setting while you are still collecting portal URLs — each portal
serves the game from a different host, and sandboxed iframes send
`Origin: null`, so an early allowlist mostly locks out your own game. Once you
know the real list:

```toml
ALLOWED_ORIGINS = "https://www.crazygames.com,https://html5.gamemonetize.com"
```

Then `npm run deploy` again.

## Watching it in production

* **Live logs:** `npx wrangler tail` (from `worker/`), or the dashboard under
  **Workers & Pages → leaderboard-tree-smashers → Logs**.
* **Quota use:** same page, **Metrics**. Watch requests/day (100 k) and D1 rows
  **written**/day (100 k). Reads are effectively free under this design: a view
  costs one row or zero, and a submission three. The fixed ceiling is the two
  materialised rebuilds — the board every `BOARD_TTL_MS` and the histogram every
  `DIST_TTL_MS` — which together are a low tens of thousands of rows a day
  whatever the traffic does.
* **The data:** **Storage & Databases → D1 → leaderboard-tree-smashers → Console**
  runs SQL straight from the browser, e.g.
  `SELECT * FROM scores ORDER BY score DESC LIMIT 20;`

## Clearing the rows an unstable identity left behind

If the board holds several rows for the same person — the symptom of a build
that could mint a fresh id per session — the honest fix is to empty it and let
the current build repopulate. The rows cannot be merged reliably.

```powershell
cd worker
npx wrangler d1 execute leaderboard-tree-smashers --remote --command "DELETE FROM scores"
# The materialised top-N is a separate row and does not clear itself.
npx wrangler d1 execute leaderboard-tree-smashers --remote --command "DELETE FROM board_cache"
```

## The histogram on `/top`, and the baked board

`GET /top` returns the published rows **and** a histogram of every score:

```json
{
  "updatedAt": 1757254334067,
  "total": 2422,
  "entries": [
    ...
    100
    rows
    ...
  ],
  "dist": [
    [
      134,
      1
    ],
    [
      74,
      1
    ],
    [
      72,
      1
    ],
    ...
  ]
}
```

`dist` is `[score, howManyPlayersHaveIt]`, ordered score-descending, so the
client can compute the rank this Worker would — `COUNT(*) WHERE score > ?` plus
one — for **any** score, without asking. That is what makes every rank in the
game EXACT: the rows stop at 100, and on a board of thousands almost every
player sits below that cut. Without the histogram the client falls back to
estimating their placing from the published rows and the population count — a
plausible number, but a guess. The player never sees "#100+" either way; the
histogram is what makes the number true.

The histogram is materialised into `board_cache` under the id `dist` and rebuilt
only when that row is older than `DIST_TTL_MS` (one hour). This matters: its
`GROUP BY score` is the one query here that reads every row, so it must never
run per request or on the write path.

### The snapshot

```powershell
pnpm leaderboard:snapshot        # writes data/leaderboard-snapshot.json
```

Every build bakes that file (`vite.config.ts` refreshes it first, skipping if it
was fetched in the last ten minutes so a run of portal builds makes one
request). On Poki and Yandex it IS the leaderboard; everywhere else it is the
bottom rung of the offline ladder. **Commit the JSON** — that is what makes an
offline build reproducible.

Set `LEADERBOARD_SNAPSHOT_URL` to point the refresh at a staging Worker.
