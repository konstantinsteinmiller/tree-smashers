 *           which is unfixable from the client and looks like the board eating

 *   WHAT  — a display name. Gets it wrong and a row is mislabelled, which is
 *           annoying and self-correcting.

 * Neither ever prompts. A leaderboard that opens a text field before the player
 * has played is a leaderboard most players never appear on.
