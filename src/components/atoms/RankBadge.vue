/**
 * ─── "#1130 of 2345" ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The whole leaderboard, reduced to one pill on the result screen. It is the
 * only part of this feature most players ever see, and the population is the
 * half that makes the placing mean something: a bare "#1130" says nothing.
 *
 * THREE STATES, and only one of them is a number:
 *
 *   • a rank        → `#1130`, plus `of 2345` once the population has landed
 *   • still waiting → `…`, holding the cell's width so the row of chips does
 *                     not jump sideways when the rank arrives a beat later
 *   • nothing to say → the badge does not render AT ALL
 *
 * THERE IS NO "#100+" STATE, and adding one back is a regression. A placing
 * this component cannot state as a number is not shown as prose instead — the
 * ladder in `useLeaderboard` guarantees a real number from a histogram, or an
 * estimated one, or nothing. `rankFor` returns no sentinel for a template to
 * decorate, which is the point: the rule is enforced where the number is made,
 * not in every screen that shows one.
 *
 * The empty state is the one to respect. An empty plaque is a question the
 * screen cannot answer, and a permanent "Loading…" on a player with no
 * connection reads as a broken game. Once the fetch has actually failed the
 * badge is gone and stays gone — though it rarely comes to that, because the
 * offline ladder usually has a cached or baked board to rank against, and the
 * player never learns which one answered.
 *
 * `score` is a PROP rather than an import so this component is drop-in: it does
 * not know where the game keeps its lifetime best. Pass the same number
 * `reportRun` is called with.
