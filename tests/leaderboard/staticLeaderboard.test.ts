/**
 * ─── The board, baked at build time ─────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Poki forbids every external runtime request and Yandex rejects third-party
 * storage URLs at moderation, so both builds ship `VITE_LEADERBOARD_URL` empty.
 * Until now that meant no leaderboard at all. They now ship a copy of the board
 * taken when the bundle was built, and rank the player against it.
 *
 * Two properties carry the whole feature, and they pull in opposite directions:
 *
 *   THE GAME MUST SHOW A RANK.      THE GAME MUST MAKE NO REQUEST.
 *
 * Every case below pins one or the other. The endpoint is read from
 * `import.meta.env` once at module scope and the snapshot is imported once at
 * module scope, so each case re-imports under `vi.resetModules()` — which is
 * exactly how the real thing is decided: at build time, never at runtime.
 */

/**
 * A board shaped like the real one: a long tail, a deliberate TIE, and a
 * published slice far smaller than the population — which is the whole problem
 * the histogram exists to solve.
 *
 * 24 players. The four published rows cut off at score 30, so scores 1–29 are
 * below every row the old code could see.
