/**
 * ─── The baked leaderboard ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Fetches the live board from the Cloudflare Worker and writes it to
 * `data/leaderboard-snapshot.json`, which `vite.config.ts` then ships as the
 * virtual module `virtual:leaderboard-snapshot`.
 *
 * WHY A BUILD-TIME COPY EXISTS AT ALL. Two of the portals forbid the runtime
 * request the board is normally made of — Poki bans every external runtime
 * request outright, and Yandex's moderators reject third-party storage URLs —
 * so both builds ship `VITE_LEADERBOARD_URL` empty and, until now, simply had
 * no leaderboard. A snapshot is not a workaround for those rules: it is inside
 * them. The bytes are part of the bundle, and the game makes no request.
 *
 * WHY THE HISTOGRAM AND NOT JUST THE TOP 100. `/top` publishes 100 rows, and on
 * a board of a few thousand that cut sits far above where a first-session
 * player ever gets. Rows alone could tell 4 % of players exactly where they
 * stand and leave the other 96 % — including everyone in the session Poki's fit
 * test grades — on an estimate. So `/top` also carries a histogram of the WHOLE
 * population, and that is what both this snapshot and the live game rank
 * against. Baking it costs about a kilobyte and makes every rank exact.
 *
 * Run it by hand before a portal build:
 *
 *     pnpm leaderboard:snapshot
 *
 * The build refreshes it too, but never fails on it — see `readSnapshot`.
